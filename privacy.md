## 1. Data We Collect

| Data | Why We Collect It | How Long We Keep It |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Approximate Location** (city-level coordinates) | To fill the map with YouTube videos filmed near your current view. | Held **in memory only** and discarded when you close the app (≤ 24 h). |
| **Crash Logs** | To diagnose bugs and improve performance. | Stored in Apple’s TestFlight / Xcode organizer for up to 30 days. |

We **do not** collect personal identifiers, contacts, photos, messages, health data, or any form of advertising ID. No data is sold or shared with third parties.

## 2. How We Use Data

* Deliver core features (showing nearby video pins).  
* Monitor and fix crashes.  
We never use collected data for advertising, marketing, or user profiling.

## 3. Data Sharing

* **Apple**: Crash reports are processed by Apple’s TestFlight infrastructure.
